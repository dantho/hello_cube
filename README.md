# Hello World with Ambient

This repo is _mainly_ intended to host the markdown published [on github pages](https://dantho.github.io/hello_cube/).  Its an ECS Game Engine 101 tutorial I'm writing for myself.  But this repo also hosts the code used.

I'll be discussing (learning about) these topics in the Beginners-Corner on [Ambient's Discord channel](https://discord.gg/ambient).
