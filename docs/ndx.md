## 0.1. [Install Ambient](https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/user/installing.html) (<--Url)

I'm excited about Ambient because I like Rust and I like games.  I think I might like to build something.  Ambient seems shiny and new and _powerful_ (in concept and in code already delivered.)  I sorta love the idea of a Rust stack all the way down to WASM, which does all the rest of the work to go anywhere bits can go.

I'm also a complete beginner when it comes to game engines or ECS (Entity Component System).  Ambient is a bit young for a Game Building 101 tutorial to exist, though. They say a great way to learn is to teach*.  Why not write my own!!

(*In defense of teachers everywhere, they usually don't say this to complete beginners.  In my defense, I do know _some_ stuff.)

I'll be taking notes on my journey to learn ECS and Ambient here in this repo.  For now, it's just interconnected markdown pages.

I'll be discussing it in the Beginners-Corner on [Ambient's Discord channel](https://discord.gg/ambient).
